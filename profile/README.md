# The Art of Tech: Not Playing with a Full Tech

If you would like to know more about our group please see [ABOUT.md](https://github.com/taotnpwaft/metadata/blob/main/ABOUT.md)

This is the global repository for documentation and the intellectual property for the The Art of Tech: Not Playing with a Full Tech community. It also contains our group projects.  

We use GitHub to maintain our group. We are on our way to becoming an OpenGovernance and an OpenOrganization as well as adopting FOSS/OSS policies.

## Our Rules and Policies

See here: [Rules](https://github.com/taotnpwaft/metadata/blob/main/GROUP_POLICY_DRAFT.md) [DRAFT] 

This is working draft of our core policy.  It needs significant work to be implemented and will eventually end up [here](https://github.com/taotnpwaft/docs/) when it is final and adopted.

## Our Projects

There are many projects we are getting started on including our [Website](https://github.com/taotnpwaft/website). See Tech Stack: Website below. 

There is a list of some projects [here](https://github.com/taotnpwaft/projects/discussions/3) and [here](https://github.com/taotnpwaft/projects/discussions/7) you could possibly work on and contribute too.

At some point we would like to release a Linux distribution from scratch, which would not be a re-spin.  If there is interest in that, let us know.
We are also working on a retro Operating System (OS) indended for x86 IA-32 made with C.

If you are a .NET developer with knowledge of .NET 3.1 to .NET 5, REACT, Angular, and do PHP and SQL or other backend work let us know as well.

## Our Team

We have a small number of contributors who maintain this organization.  If you would like to become a member of our team working on individual projects. You can request to be a member of our teams [here](https://github.com/orgs/taotnpwaft/teams). 

[This](https://github.com/taotnpwaft/projects/tree/main/config) repository also contains editor configuration/settings and workspace files for Sublime Text, Visual Studio, VSCode to aid staff in creating group content and other meta files and documentation.

We would like this organization and repository to become a model for other similar social media technology groups who wish to get their metadata in order to start. It could also be useful for tech and programming/coding streamers with a significant community.
